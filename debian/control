Description: reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with many mail user agents.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 Bug reporting in Debian relies on email; reportbug can use a local
 mail transport agent (like exim or sendmail), submit directly through
 an external mail server, or pass messages to an installed mail user
 agent (e.g., mutt) for submission.
 .
 This package also includes the "querybts" script for browsing the
 Debian bug tracking system.
