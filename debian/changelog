reportbug (3.18) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "take this job and shove it" release.
  * Update smtphost setting for bug reporting.  reportbug now generates

reportbug (3.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "widows and orphans" release (aka hopefully the last release
    before I start hacking on reportbug 4).
  * Use mbox format when accessing the Debian BTS.  This will hopefully
    avoid breakage due to presentation changes--at least for report pages;

reportbug (3.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Respect Bccs when using MTAs and MUAs; note that broken MUAs may fail
    to suppress the Bcc field when they send, and that's not my
    problem--blame the MUA author.  However, this code works around broken
    MTAs.  Note that smtphost behavior was correct in 3.8.

    uninstalled packages (although I can't completely confirm it fixes the

    me an easy way to tell a Ubuntu system from a Debian one, I will
    incorporate code to eliminate the need for the forked package.  Same

  * The "why the f*ck isn't the Internet 8-bit clean by now?" release.
  * I think I've worked around the QP problems by forcing the body to not

    for your locale.  If your MTA doesn't like this, get a better MTA.
    It's 2003 already.  BTW, your MTA (or someone else's) may decide to
    QP-encode the message anyway just to be friendly.  (Closes: #198663)
  * As a side effect while debugging, I also fixed a crasher where your
    locale says you're in us-ascii but you decide to put 8-bit chars in
    your headers just for entertainment value.  Fallback on iso-8859-15
    (aka Latin9 or "iso-8859-1 with the euro"), since that's as good a
    guess as any these days.  But you really should set your locale...

    Issue a stern warning if you try to file a report on a version of a
    package that isn't yet in Debian *cough* X4.3.  (Closes: #194615)
  * Add option for "completely stupid smtphost mode" in the initial

    which should enable bug reporting from even the most basic system.
    This path will also allow configuring the smtphost setting.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Oct 2002 18:23:47 -0500

reportbug (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * reportbug 2 is now feature-frozen while I attend to other things, like
    the mythical menu rewrite.  Version number updated accordingly.
  * If you want reportbug 2 in testing, see #162467.  (Note my kindness in
    providing a patch for the override file.)
  * Correct variable name in attaching/including files from menu.
    (Closes: #163125)
  * I think #163121 and #161767 are both proxy issues; someone who uses
    proxies will have to figure them out...

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Oct 2002 02:48:19 -0500

reportbug (1.99.64) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suppress "include debconf output" prompt when in template mode.

reportbug (1.99.57) unstable; urgency=low

reportbug (1.99.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optionally suppress user ID checking.  Root will still be checked,
    even if no-check-uid is set in .reportbugrc or /etc/reportbug.conf,
    however.  (Closes: #160496)

  * Add pattern matching support for searching bugs.  Many, many thanks to
    Ha Shao for the patch!  (Closes: #109674)
  * Better handling for 8-bit characters in headers.  (Closes: #156074)
  * Now defaults to using your locale's character set as the character set
    of the outgoing message.
  * Support MIME attachments.  (Closes: #146329)
    (This may confuse some MUAs, although at least mutt should handle it.)
  * Support gzip-encoded HTTP.  Thanks to Bastian Kleineidam for the
    patch.  (Closes: #160310)
    I added deflate (zlib) support and code to send the headers to request
    compressed pages by default (although Apache at bugs.debian.org
    doesn't yet support this).

reportbug (1.99.53) unstable; urgency=low

    Thanks to Ha Shao for the HTML parser improvements.
    (The newt interface hasn't been updated for this change.)

reportbug (1.99.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Despite severity inflation, fix relatively minor bug in the
    metapackage code.  (Free hint: if something doesn't work with one
    particular command line option, that is not a GRAVE bug.  Perhaps you
    should run in novice mode from now on...)  (Closes: #155686)

  * 'S'kip is now permitted in the BTS browser always, even if you're on
    the last page.  (Closes: #151755)
  * Retain case of character in reportbug_ui_text.select_options() help.
  * In MODE_NOVICE, helpfully provide a prompt where you are supposed to
    type the bug text in the editor.  This prompt is stripped from the
    message after editing.
  * Cleaned up external script support.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 17:49:11 -0400

  * The Toronto Minus 1 release.
  * aka The "Why doesn't gnome-terminal 2 show 8-bit characters?" release.
  * Massively clean up the gpg/pgp code by using the miracle of pipes.
    Also make it work again in the process.  (Closes: #151723)
  * A vague implementation of GNUS support in reportbug, courtesy of
    Tollef Fog Heen - much appreciated!  (Closes: #128193)
    (Probably doesn't cope with --header or --list-cc yet.)
  * Only include the signature in kudos if options.mua is empty.
  * Move the signing code so bailing out in it won't send bogus empty
    messages to your MTA.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Jul 2002 01:27:08 -0500

reportbug (1.99.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Toronto Minus 2 release.
  * Added kudos option.  (Closes: #145250)
  * The sid tag is now displayed (it was hidden before).
  * Since the "kernel" metapackage is no longer offered (we offer
    kernel-image instead), detecting the kernel with /proc/version is not
    useful.  Instead, file reports on kernel-image and choose the relevant
    kernel on your system when prompted.  (Closes: #146123)

  * Find lost changes to reportbug_ui_text.py that never got checked into
    CVS.  (Closes: #150012, #150687)
  * Clarify man page description of --proxy.  Note that the http_proxy
    environment variable is also honored.  (Closes: #149956)
  * Remove -L from man page.  (Closes: #150709)
  * Only invoke debsums if state is installed.  (Closes: #150671)

  * Include patched urllib2.py in the package to (hopefully) fix proxy
    issues.  (Closes: #149446, #144480)
    [This will go away when fixed in the python2.2 package.  Note that we
    don't divert the existing file; it's just dumped in /usr/share/reportbug]
  * Add /usr/share/reportbug to the beginning of the module search path.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Jun 2002 12:03:35 -0500

reportbug (1.99.33) unstable; urgency=low

    cases where None might be displayed instead of the detected name and
    email address.  (Closes: #148722)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Jun 2002 18:22:26 -0500

reportbug (1.99.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now offer configuration of the offline setting in --configure.
  * Include all the operating modes in --configure.
  * Clean up the depends code (pass around a list instead of a silly string).
  * Add support for "dependency packages" (i.e. packages that only exist
    to provide dependencies that vary by platform, like gcc-defaults).
    Note that this support is in addition to the existing virtual package
    support.  (Closes: #148602)
    ATM gcc-defaults is the only such package I know about; please let me
    know any others by filing a wishlist bug.
  * Cache get_package_status() results so we don't query multiple times on
    the same package.
  * ui.menu() and ui.select_options() now tolerate blank input when there
    is no default setting.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Jun 2002 16:33:21 -0500

reportbug (1.99.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up the rc file processing of toggles.
  * does-not-build actually works again.  (Closes: #147713)
  * Change mta -> options.mta.  (Closes: #147685, I hope)
  * Added "advanced" mode, which is like "standard" but not.  (The main
    difference is that "standard" now ignores incoming, for better or for
    worse.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 22 May 2002 06:28:08 -0500

reportbug (1.99.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --offline option.  (Closes: #147375)
  * Ignore mua setting if --template is specified.  (Closes: #147343)
  * Extra logic to make 'none' and 'done' work properly in
    ui.select_multiple.  (Closes: #147339)
  * Always set realname and email in .reportbugrc after running
    --configure, rather than commenting them out if they are identical to
    the settings discovered in the environment.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 18 May 2002 18:15:31 -0500

reportbug (1.99.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only check package integrity if it is installed.  (Closes: #147215)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 16 May 2002 16:38:55 -0500

reportbug (1.99.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * In MODE_NOVICE, ignore incoming as newbies probably don't know or care
    about it.
  * Document in the man page that you can use an absolute path instead of
    a package name for filing a report.  (--file is probably more fun to
    use in the general case, though.)  (Closes: #147139)
  * Fixup a few import issues that arose while fixing #147133.

reportbug (1.99.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload of reportbug 2 to unstable, since woody is now fully
    frozen.  Now requires Python 2.2.  (Closes: #127716)
    + This introduces a priority imbalance bug in unstable.  Since Python
      >= 2.2 will be the default Python for woody+1, this is a temporary
      situation.
    + Please see the changelog entries through 1.99.0 for changes from 1.50.
    + Various items were marked as fixed in experimental.
      (Closes: #113284, 135704)
  * Removed debugging info from output when using debsums.
  * Use full path when calling debsums.
  * Fix a buglet that left sendto unset.
  * Fix a bug in the bug script when .reportbugrc is not empty.
  * You now can only select each tag once.  (Closes: #146156)
    (Implemented in the text UI: ui.select_multiple)
  * Menu prompts are now displayed when stdout is redirected.
    (Closes: #145936)
  * Check packages.debian.org in addition to the status database when
    filing an ITP/RFP, as the status database may include false positives
    when the package is built locally but not in Debian.  (Closes: #146614)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 12 May 2002 22:10:17 -0500

reportbug (1.99.16) experimental; urgency=low

  * --configure didn't work in .15; fixed.
  * Relax the justification check for serious bugs.  (Closes: #144803)
  * Ignore $TMPDIR if it isn't a valid directory.  (Closes: #144472)
  * Note that LC_CTYPE is overridden by LC_ALL in Locale settings section.
    (The output was correct, as interpreted by libc.)  (Closes: #141610)
  * Added debsums support; enabled in the distributed reportbug.conf.
    (Closes: #142334)

reportbug (1.99.15) experimental; urgency=low

  * Integrated latest GNOME patch from Robin Putters.
    + Minor reworking to change ui.EXCEPTION into EXCEPTION.
    + Backed out the move of ui.handle_bts_query().  The GNOME frontend
      will need its own query routine.  For now, it raises NotImplemented.
  * debconf-show output will be included if available.  (See #142593)
  * Cleaned up the address rewriting stuff.
  * Massively sped up reportbug.get_package_info() by combining 2*DEPS
    regexps into 2 regexps.  This speeds up reporting a bug on "lsb" by
    almost a minute on a PIII-450.
  * Rewrote the option parser to use Optik.  The main user-visible effect
    is that reportbug --help is now a lot more useful.
  * Defined a new ui entry point: select_multiple.  It should allow the
    user to select multiple, nonexclusive options and return a list of the
    selected options.  (Currently not implemented in any ui module, but
    eventually will be used for tags.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Apr 2002 04:26:07 -0500

reportbug (1.99.14) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updates from 1.50
  * You can now report bugs in "kernel-image" and it will show a list of
    packages to choose from.  (This is the normal virtual package
    behavior, but I had to do some work to make it function because
    kernel-image is in the menu.)
  * Minor code cleanups to get some lines < 80 chars.

  * Fix source queries when the source package and binary package are the
    same (in this case, src_package is not set).
  * Cleanup wording of the "new release" message.
  * Add debian-policy to the virtual packages list.  (Closes: #139970)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Apr 2002 22:35:35 -0600

reportbug (1.99.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * Query on source packages when searching for bugs in the BTS by
    default.  (Closes: #138928)
  * Any editor that has "emacs" in its name will now jump to a line number;
    this avoids needing to add emacs32 when it comes out...
  * Broke up the bug handling script into a script and a presubj.
  * Include user configuration file in reports on reportbug.
  * Converted ui.select_options(message, 'yn'...) to
    ui.yes_no(message...); this will help make non-text UIs cleaner, and
    may eventually aid i18n support.  (This also cleaned up a lot of
    superfluous temporary variables in the code.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Mar 2002 23:32:33 -0600

reportbug (1.99.11) experimental; urgency=low

reportbug (1.99.9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Integrated changes from 1.46-1.47.
  * Added support for a "virtual" severity: does-not-build
  * Check buildd.debian.org for does-not-build bugs.  (Closes: #137607)
  * Changed maintonly default to no on wishlist/minor bugs.
  * Some wnpp bugs don't require BTS queries.  (Closes: #138071)

  * Removed debugging output from urllib calls.
  * Fixed calls to ewrite() in querybts

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 22:09:02 -0600

reportbug (1.99.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * reportbug 1.99.5 implemented the option of sending a report directly
    to the maintainer if the package was not found in the BTS; I forgot to
    mention it in the changelog.  Mea culpa.  (See #135704, #135710;
    already closed.)
  * Include GNOME interface patch from Robin Putters, and add some
    work-arounds to the code to handle GNOME nicely.
  * Ripped out the urllib code and replaced it with urllib2 code.  This
    makes proxy authentication work in some circumstances, but it still
    needs additional work, particularly with bad proxy servers.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 02:21:40 -0600

reportbug (1.99.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Checking for new versions can be disabled using --no-check-available
    or the parallel config option.
  * Added reportbug_exceptions.py for UI exception definitions.
  * Cull duplicate entries in the dependency output when both a real
    package and a virtual that is provided by that package exist.
    (e.g. packages with exim | mail-transport-agent no longer list exim
    twice if you have it installed.)

  * Integrated changes from 1.43.
  * Tab completion of bug numbers is now supported in the text interface.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Feb 2002 12:28:06 -0600

reportbug (1.99.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Beginning of reportbug 2.0 rewrite.
  * Partially rewritten in Python 2.2 syntax.  More to come, no doubt.
  * Modules moved to /usr/share/reportbug to better comport with Debian's
    Python policy.
  * Cleaned up installation of Python modules.
  * Added operating mode support (expert/novice/standard).  (Closes: #121434)
  * First-time configuration added.  (Closes: #118176)
  * Don't worry, I'm working my way through the wishlist...

reportbug (1.42) unstable; urgency=medium

  * I give up on sqrt(2)...
  * Wishlist items from here out will only be implemented in the
    (not-yet-released) experimental branch.
  * WNPP support now works with source and unknown packages.  (Closes: #131765)
  * No longer prompt when the subject was generated by the WNPP support.
    (Closes: #131100)
  * Silly me forgot that string.strip() gets rid of leading whitespace, so
    my implementation of #131472 didn't work.  Now it does, and it's been
    tested.  (Closes: #131472)
  * The mutt message has been defanged (for most, at least).  Subsequent
    reports of this issue will be merged with #131100.  You have been warned.
  * Added a diagnostic routine, per README.developers spec.
    (It also shows how to write one in something other than bash.)

reportbug (1.41.1421356) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use $EDITOR in preference to $VISUAL.  (Closes: #131610)
    This makes reportbug act like the man page claims it does.
  * Back off a bit on #131100, due to popular demand.  Just checking to
    see if anyone is actually using these packages...
  * Fix WNPP support to use source packages, not binary packages, when
    orphaning or RFA'ing a package.  (Closes: #131471)
  * Include the full description of an WNPP'd package.  (Closes: #131472)
  * Modified the prompt when the BTS browser is in standalone mode.

reportbug (1.41.142135) unstable; urgency=low

  * It'd be nice if this were the last release for woody...
  * Handle .'s in the realname part of addresses correctly, as
    rfc822.quote() doesn't seem to work right.  (Closes: #127637)
  * Add message warning certain users not to attach stuff in external
    programs until debbugs is fixed to handle MIME correctly, at which
    time this message will look incredibly stupid.  "Fixes" my part of
    #131100 ("Chris should never have let people edit messages in programs
    that can attach MIME, and therefore is responsible for problems in
    debbugs.").  Alternate solution: disable --mutt.  Y'alls' choice.
  * Update copyright year in modified files.
  * Warn if subject > 60 characters.  (Closes: #129099)
  * Added security.debian.org to valid pseudopackages.  (Closes: #129889)
  * Warn if run with uid < 500.  (Closes: #128936)
    (I chose 500 since systems converted from other distributions may have
    real users with IDs >= 500.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Jan 2002 17:41:41 -0600

reportbug (1.41.14213) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "hopefully we won't run out of double precision in sqrt(2)" release.
  * Work around lack of socket.fqdn() in Python 1.5.2 by swiping the
    routine from Python 2.1+ and backporting.  This only affects systems
    that didn't have a valid /etc/mailname, and thus would have died
    running reportbug (< 1.41.14) anyway. (Closes: #126867)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Dec 2001 00:38:18 -0800

reportbug (1.41.1421) unstable; urgency=low

  * Menu entries are now numbered in the text UI.  (Closes: #123975)
  * Bugs can be selected by a short number from the text BTS browser.
    (Closes: #118333)
  * Check /etc/email-addresses for an email address, if available.
  * Allow $DEBFULLNAME as an alternative for $DEBNAME.
  * If /etc/mailname doesn't exist, use socket.getfqdn() instead.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Dec 2001 22:47:34 -0600

reportbug (1.41.1) unstable; urgency=medium

reportbug (1.41) unstable; urgency=medium

    I'll figure out enough CVS to actually maintain this branch with it
    too...
  * Followup-For now recognized as a pseudoheader.
    (Closes: self-discovered-bug)
  * Warn when the severity is downgraded by the severity lameness filter.
    (Closes: #122962)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Dec 2001 02:49:05 -0600

reportbug (1.40) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Third crack at a final woody release.  The 1.x series will approach
    sqrt(2) asymptotically from here out.
  * Cleaned up .reportbugrc handling code even more.  As a bonus, 'bts'
    finally works as a config file option...
  * Suppress stderr diagnostics from dpkg --search.
  * Fix severity specification in rc files, for real this time.  A silly
    thinko was stopping it from working.  (Closes: #122539)
  * Fix crash when --file is specified and not found.  Also a side-effect
    of implementing #121707.  (Closes: #122648)
  * Explicitly warn the user that temporary files might be located in
    temporary directories, and thus might not persist.  (Closes: #122652)

  * If the specified package name looks like a filename, act like -f was
    specified.  (Closes: #121707)
  * You can now specify an editor with --editor (-e) or in .reportbugrc.
    (Closes: #121736)
  * Include a slightly-modified copy of bug's README.developers, to better
    document the per-package hook options.

reportbug (1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle Justification: serious better.  (Closes: #120631)
  * If a package name is Provided by another package on the system, and not
    installed itself, allow the user to select amongst the packages
    Providing it.  (For example, you can do "reportbug fetchmail" even if
    fetchmail-ssl is installed.)  (Closes: #121054)

reportbug (1.36) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "reportbug has fan mail" release (see this week's LWN Letters page).
  * Work around #119815 by conflicting with python-newt 0.50.17-7.1.
  * In some weird situations, reportbug could bomb out with an exception
    if no package was specified.  (Closes: #119853)
  * The unversioned recommendation for python-newt is deliberate.
    This way an upgraded reportbug should work safely on a
    partially-upgraded potato system.  (Closes: #119142)
    (No python >> 1.5 features will be used until reportbug 2.0.)
  * Added source report support to querybts and reportbug.
    Use querybts --source or select a source package in reportbug.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Nov 2001 20:41:39 -0600

reportbug (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option: --mta.  Allows you to specify an alternate path for a
    sendmail clone; it must accept standard sendmail options.
    (Closes: #116751)
  * Don't clear the screen in querybts if using the text ui.
  * reportbug will run with any version of Python in the archive; however,
    there doesn't seem to be a clean way to handle this yet.  For now,
    depend on python1.5-base | python-base (<< 2.1) until this gets
    straightened out.
  * Downgraded python-newt to a (very strong) recommendation, since
    querybts can run without it.
  * Removed reference to Progeny Debian in the description.

  * Changed Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep.  (Fixes lintian
    warning.)

  * Better error message when you enter a bug number not listed.
    Note that you can enter any bug number at the "more info" prompt; this

  * Fix documentation and program so --filename actually works as a long
    option.  (Closes: #95057)
  * Remove the discussion of querybts's option "-w" in reportbug.1
    (Closes: #95786)
  * Add explicit quit option to the internal BTS browser.  (Closes: #96589)
  * reportbug seems to run under Python 2.0 here; applied patch from
    Gordon Sadler to fix bug comparison.  (Closes: #95481)
  * Make sure allow_numbers is passed on in recursive calls to
    select_options() in reportbug_ui_text.  (Closes: #95553)
  * If unable to connect to the BTS, prompt for abort instead of just
    barrelling on through.  (Closes: #96005)
  * Include locale information in the System Information section of bug
    reports.  (Closes: #95805)
  * Include date of submission in displayed reports.  (Closes: #93733)
  * Include the bug report number in a pseudoheader in followup reports.

reportbug (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Port forward a fix from 0.54.1 in LDAP queries.
  * Fix description of the '-d' option in the help.  (Closes: #87821)
  * minor and wishlist bugs now prompt the submitter whether or not they
    should go to maintonly.  (Closes: #87122)
  * Better heuristic for non-existent packages when querying.
    (Closes: #86149)
  * Fix use of deprecated list.append(x,y) for list.append((x,y)).
    (Closes: #93159)
  * Ensure there is a prompt on followups to existing reports.
    (Closes: #88960)
  * Update long description to make it more useful in the context of being
    a "standard" package.

reportbug (1.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * The root URL for the Debian BTS's CGI scripts has changed.  This
    probably breaks the version in stable horribly, so I may backport a
    fix for proposed-updates.  (Closes: #86032)
  * Rename 'helixcode' to 'ximian'; keep 'helixcode' as an alias for the
    Ximian bug tracking system.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Feb 2001 16:12:45 -0600

reportbug (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * I guess 1.12 wasn't as horribly buggy as I thought it might be :-)
  * Fix reporting with packages that have ": " in their description, like
    gkrellm.  (Closes: #85275)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Feb 2001 12:08:31 -0600

reportbug (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "wait until a good version is in testing before breaking
    everything horribly" release.
  * User interface abstraction in progress... this version may be slightly
    more unstable than usual.  Currently installs reportbug_ui_text
    (working) and reportbug_ui_newt (not fully working for reportbug,
    but used by querybts).
  * For kicks, try querybts --ui=text.  If it breaks, both pieces are yours.
  * Remove dependency on whiptail; all querybts dialogs are now handled by
    python-newt.
  * Improvements in screen handling in querybts.  This should resolve the
    remaining issues with #82895.  (Closes: #82895)
  * Fix skip command in the reportbug browser when there is more than one
    page of bugs in the same category.  (Closes: #84327)
  * Looking at individual bug reports in reportbug now works a bit
    differently; you are now prompted if you want to give more info and
    can launch a browser to look at that bug.  (To put it another way: the
    functionality of querybts is merged in, even in text mode.  UI
    abstraction is our friend.)  Downside: a few more keypresses to look
    at lots of reports.
  * You can now quit while looking at a report in querybts.  (Closes: #62614)
  * redisplay now shows the last screenful, not just min(last_screenful,
    last_category).  Someone complained about this in an already-closed
    report (in addition to the main issue, which was resolved elsewhere).
  * Don't clear the screen in querybts if it exits without an exception.
  * pgp/gpg signing now omits the pseudoheaders from the signed section.
  * Report numbers with a leading # now really work in querybts.  Note that
    you'll have to escape (or quote) the # in many shells...
  * Remove some cruft from the source tree.
  * Incorporated support for the Progeny BTS.  Queries are not available
    (I have not written a GNATS query module), but report submission is.
  * -C command line option incorporated to specify the class of the report
    for gnats servers.
  * -S command line option allows either gnats or debbugs severities.
    These are mapped transparently to the severity appropriate for the
    specified BTS (i.e. wishlist on debbugs becomes non-critical for
    gnats; non-critical for gnats becomes normal for Debian).
  * The --bts option now overrides whatever's detected from the package
    info.  However, bts options in the rc files will not override that
    setting.  This seems like a reasonable default so Origin makes sense
    on Debian forks, who can set /etc/reportbug.conf to point to their BTS.
  * Updated TODO list to add some things that have been kicking around in
    my head.
  * If multiple packages match a file requested by the -f option, list the
    first 3 matching files for each package.
  * Old --quiet is now --report-quiet; removed short option.
  * New --quiet suppresses diagnostic output to stderr; nothing except
    prompts should be written to the screen by reportbug when this flag is
    specified.  Primarily for UI testing.
  * reportbug now has special prompt support for particular packages.
    This is particularly useful with pseudopackages like wnpp, wherein the
    severity of the report should be based on the subject (and the subject
    should include certain keywords).  (Note that this is different from
    the "included in package" prompt support, which has been supported for
    some time.)  Try reporting a wnpp bug to see what it does... who
    knows, you may even like it ;-)
  * Updated priority to 'standard'.

reportbug (1.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Another fix to -B option.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Jan 2001 18:21:24 -0600

reportbug (1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix -B option when a package's status is not queried by reportbug.
    (Closes: #83552)
  * Somewhat better handling of bogus $http_proxy settings.  reportbug and
    querybts still fail with an exception, but it gives a hint why.  Also
    document the syntax even more explicitly in the man pages.  (Closes: #83301)
  * You can now do 'querybts #82843' (allowing a leading #).  (Closes: #82843)
  * If you're running querybts under Python 2.x, use the webbrowser module
    instead of our own internal logic.  (Closes: #83545)
  * Handle missing reports more gracefully.  (Closes: #83579)
  * List all addresses a report is sent to, not just those specified on the
    command line.  (Closes: #81609)
  * If you request more info on a bug, $PAGER will be used.
    (Closes: #82791, #48328)
  * reportbug now runs if readline cannot be imported.
  * Tab-completion is now supported at some prompts if the readline module
    can be imported.  This affects the severity prompt and the packages
    prompt at the moment.  (Closes: #81496, #82843)
  * Leading and trailing spaces on input are now stripped.  This shouldn't
    hurt anything, and makes tab completion behave nicely.
  * Complies to policy 3.2.1.0, no changes necessary.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Jan 2001 00:41:34 -0600

reportbug (1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix crasher in reportbug -f.  (Closes: #81060, #81134)
  * The -o option now overrides any mua setting.  (Closes: #81048)
  * reportbug no longer displays multiple screenfuls at once.
    (Closes: #48444)  Thanks to Shaleh for his suggested fix.
  * You can redisplay the last set of bugs listed too.  (Closes: #49154)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Jan 2001 21:21:31 -0600

reportbug (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert time locale in reportbug.rfcdatestr() after calling strftime.
  * Try to find a file specified with -f before following symlinks.
    (Closes: #78583)
  * Quote the "real name" part of email addresses using rfc822.quote if
    necessary.
  * Accepts $REPORTBUGEMAIL as a possible From address; also, now the
    --email option (and email config file option) override any environment
    variables except $REPORTBUGEMAIL.  (Closes: #79976)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Dec 2000 14:48:31 -0600

reportbug (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Virtual packages list synchronized with

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Dec 2000 21:55:10 -0600

reportbug (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Serious" severity was misnamed "severe," so people could not file
    serious bug reports.  (Closes: #78412)
  * Fix followup template bug.  (Closes: #78434)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Nov 2000 20:18:06 -0600

  * Rename local variable "system" to "bts".  (Closes: #78037, #78038)
  * Handle "mailto" submissions.
  * Support the updated bug severities list.
  * Followup support was fixed in 1.4.  (Closes: #71842)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Nov 2000 18:18:38 -0600

reportbug (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Happy Belated Thanksgiving.
  * Fix followup boilerplate for non-Debian BTSes.  (Closes: #76790)
  * Add "minor" severity, not that I can find any documentation of its
    existence...  (Closes: #76665)
  * #75137 was fixed in 1.1 (same as #68681, I think).  (Closes: #75137)
  * Remove support for the TDYC bug tracking system, since KDE2 is in
    Debian now and the BTS there has been shut down.  (Closes: #77335)
  * Add support for the Origin and Bugs headers.  (Closes: #76669)
    Origin probably works well, Bugs probably doesn't do what you want it
    to yet (it can report to the server, but I'm almost certain it won't
    query the right server).
  * BTSes found in /etc/dpkg/origins/* will be added to the BTS list
    automatically.  Any Bugs: line other than debbugs URLs will probably not
    work, however.
  * Some internal architecture support for reporting to GNATS.  It isn't
    all there yet, so unless you want to see tracebacks tread lightly.
  * #62338 is not a bug; see the -i option.  (Closes: #62338)
  * Incredible hackery to avoid weird issues when your cwd gets deleted in
    the middle of running reportbug.  (Closes: #77954)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Nov 2000 01:03:55 -0600

reportbug (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix mh/nmh reporting, thanks to a patch from Chris Danis.

  * Fix prompt handling.  (Closes: #70048)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Sep 2000 11:52:31 -0500

reportbug (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove "USERNAME" as an environment variable to use for the user's
    "real name", since some of the build tools seem to set it to `id -un`
    for some reason.
  * "manual" is not a valid pseudopackage for Debian; remove it.
    (Closes: #69624)
  * New option: --query-only.  (Closes: #69213)
  * 'querybts -w' now uses the CGI urls for a BTS, if available.

reportbug (1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "I shoulda called it 0.99" release.
  * Fix stupid thinkos.  (Closes: #68667, #68672)
  * reportbug now thinks a package is installed unless it is in the states
    of 'config-files' (only) or 'not-installed'. (Closes: #68681)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Aug 2000 23:17:30 -0500

reportbug (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Jump to 1.0; I think the basic implementation is now stable.
  * Enabled "query-dpkg" for the Helix Code BTS, since they supply .debs.
  * LDAP is no longer the default system for communicating with the BTS.
    Config files changed accordingly.
  * '-l' means '--ldap' now, which actually makes more sense.
  * We now use the cgi interface to the Debian BTS if available.  This
    should eliminate most latency issues.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Aug 2000 04:08:00 -0500

reportbug (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "helixcode" to the list of supported BTSes.
  * Set COLUMNS before calling dpkg; this is needed to play nicely with
    upcoming dpkg 1.7.  (Closes: #66746)
  * Rationalization of the debianbts and reportbug modules.  Only things
    specific to reportbug are in the reportbug module.  (Closes: #66323)
  * Exceptions in querybts now leave the terminal in a less inconsistent
    state.
  * Missing reports no longer crash querybts.  (Closes: #67870)
  * Packages that are removed, but still have config files, are now
    correctly detected.  (Closes: #67002)
  * Handle the functions documented in the bug package's
    /usr/share/doc/bug/README.developers.  (Closes: #59401)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Jun 2000 18:31:32 -0500

reportbug (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed "Ok" button to "Quit" in querybts. (Closes: #65008)
  * Renamed --bts-query (and --no-bts-query) to --query-bts (and
    --no-query-bts) to fix a option name conflict.  (Closes: #64939)
  * Also changed the corresponding rc file options for consistency.
    Look for "unrecognized token" messages.
  * Add various versions of emacs and xemacs to the list of programs
    reportbug knows how to move the cursor start position in.

  general stuff:

  * Handle 407 "proxy authentication required" like 401 "authorization
    required" (Closes: #60445)
  * Handle empty bug bodies more gracefully.  (Closes: #63935)

  querybts stuff:
  * Renamed "cancel" as "quit" in querybts.  (Closes: #63167)
  * Fix the "cannot connect to BTS" terminal reset issue.  (Closes:
    #63443)
  * Handle missing subjects in HTTP bug lists.  (Closes: #64305)

  reportbug stuff:
  * The pager for changed config files actually works now.  (Closes: #60275)
  * Non-pseudoheaders are now acceptable in the pseudoheader section.
    (Closes: #62762, #63790)
  * Calls to raw_input() replaced with a local function that traps Ctrl-D
    and handles it gracefully.  (Closes: #62814)
  * Allow sending an empty bug report if you jump through enough hoops.
    (Closes: #63032)
  * 'i' now completely removed.  If you want to do what 'i' did, use 'm'
    in the BTS browser. (Closes: #63323)
  * I tried to work around #63970 ("weird behavior on sparc"), please test.
  * Don't fork 'tty' every time we print something.
  * Added logic to make it harder to submit a 'general' bug report, since
    I've been seeing a lot of (bogus instances of) them filed with
    reportbug lately.

  * Reporting bugs in virtual packages works again.  (Closes: #59946, #60136)
  * 'boot-floppies' is used instead of 'bootdisk' for the virtual package
    for the boot subsystem.  (Closes: #59773)
  * #59334 was fixed in 0.52 (Closes: #59334)
  * Implement basic HTTP authorization in the URLopener subclass (by
    cheating and using FancyURLopener instead).  (Closes: #59980)
  * Disabled bug template support; removed our example file.  An
    implementation of the more flexible system used by 'bug' will appear
    when I actually have some time to code.

  * Improved long description.  (Closes: #59297)
  * Fix dopey typo in fix for #58230.  (Closes: #59298)

  * reportbug: add '--bts-query' option (Closes: #57790)
  * reportbug.py: add "bug details template" support to the package.  This
    supports providing a per-package set of instructions to the user that
    will (hopefully) help the maintainer track down the bug more easily.
    It uses a file /usr/share/doc/{package}/Debian.bugtemplate, which
    should contain some special instructions for the user.  A lame example
    of this template appears in this package.  (Closes: #58816)
  * reportbug: Added maintainer name to spam.  (Closes: #58230)
  * reportbug: You can now view the modified configuration files before
    deciding whether or not to send them.  (Closes: #57710)
  * debianbts.py: The date and the submitter are listed for bugs in the
    LDAP database.  (Closes: #57711)

  * reportbug now works without python-ldap; downgrade python-ldap to a

  * Close LDAP connection after query module is no longer needed.
    (Closes: #49085)
  * querybts now supports entering a bug number at the command line.
    (Closes: #49155)
  * 'querybts -w' emulates the bugview script from "bug".  (Closes: #48360)
  * #48457 is due to the debbugs software, not reportbug, and is a feature
    of its nightly rebuild of its web pages.  (Closes: #48457)
  * querybts now respects the mirrors list from /etc/reportbug.conf
  * Reports that are too wide in querybts are now truncated at the right,
    instead of the left.  (Closes: #49150).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Nov 1999 14:04:53 -0600

reportbug (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Much better message if querybts can't run because python-newt is not
    installed.  python-newt will become a dependency of the package when
    reportbug includes the newt interface too.  (Closes: #48792)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 1999 11:19:18 -0600

reportbug (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copes better with bad/missing input in the BTS query interface.
    (Closes: #48009)
  * Better exit messages than "Aborted."  (Closes: #48615)
  * If ^C is pressed to exit, get something better-looking than a Python
    stack dump.  (Closes: #48694)
  * Now include the (somewhat incomplete) querybts program; add
    appropriate suggestion for python-newt.  (Closes: #44805)
  * No longer dies if configuration files can't be opened.
  * More informative error message if a conf file can't be read.
    (Closes: #48710)

  * Removed "fixed" from the severities menu.  You can still submit
    "fixed" bugs, but the option is now invisible.  (Closes: #47863)
  * You can submit more information about an outstanding bug from the
    query interface, using 'x' (for "extra information").
    (Closes: #47868)
  * Bug reports can be signed with either GnuPG (--gpg) or PGP (-pgp).
    You can also automatically do this (using /etc/reportbug.conf or
    ~/.reportbugrc) if desired (sign gpg|pgp).
    (cfr. "bug" wishlist item #45779)

  * Handle BTSes with mirrors; use the config file to set the priority
    ordering if desired.  (No mirror listing will lead to the default
    behavior.)  (Closes: #47488)

  * The "my feet really hurt from having to fix this standing at the
    terminal space at ALS" release.
  * Fix massively stupid thinko in 0.35. (Closes: #47533/#47538)

reportbug (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I'm headed to ALS and therefore need to get my affairs in order"
    release.  (OK, so it's not as cool as the libc release names; sue me).
  * If a special package name format is used by a BTS, use that format
    string to form queries of that BTS.  Specifically, it will sort-of
    merge the results of a query for "package" and the formatted package
    name.  [This only affects the TDYC server at present, since it's the
    only one that uses these query strings.]  (Closes: #47396)
  * A preliminary console BTS browser has been written; however, I'm
    waiting on the new newt packages to move out of Incoming before
    including it.  (Does anyone know how/if it's possible to get a newt
    text box to scroll horizontally?  That's the biggest remaining
    obstacle to having a good interface.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Oct 1999 02:12:33 -0500

  * You can now disable LDAP access (--no-ldap).
  * Fallback to HTTP access if LDAP access generates an exception
    (i.e. if connection is refused by an LDAP server).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Oct 1999 19:22:59 -0500

reportbug (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * debianbts.py now supports LDAP queries; only the "Debian" BTS uses
    this feature so far.  This helps ensure that you are aware of the current
    state of the BTS.  (Further addresses #40115)  LDAP access to Debian
    seems faster, particularly for getting the text of reports.
  * Modules are now installed in /usr/lib/site-python (version-independent
    Python module directory in Debian).  This way other packages can use
    them (I think the API is more-or-less stable).
  * Proper message if you query a specific report and it's not available.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Oct 1999 22:22:36 -0500

reportbug (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix postinst to compile the modules in the correct directory.
  * Update manpage to use 'X-Debbugs-CC' as the recommended --header
    parameter.  Note that other BTSes may use other headers.

  * When not connected to a tty, default to print-only mode.
  * --output now cancels out --print.
  * If 'stty size' returns '0 0', set reasonable defaults.  (For use in
    emacs' M-x shell).
  * Shared files now in /usr/share/reportbug.
  * Changes to reportbug.realpath() to not fully resolve certain FHS
    directories that may be local symlinks.  (Closes: #44932)
    (These are top-level directories specified by FSSTND and FHS that
    may be symlinked by local administrators to distribute files over
    multiple filesystems.)

  * Changed *.py to no longer start with #!; fixes two lintian warnings.
  * Copes much better when standard output is not a tty.  (Closes: #44437)
    This allows C-u M-! reportbug (options) in emacs to generate a nicely
    formatted report template.  Thanks to Francesco Potorti` for the

reportbug (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Code cleanups to make reportbug less Debian- and debbugs-centric.
  * Calls with -B {gnome,kde} bypass the Debian package manager and don't
    put the Debian release or architecture in the report.
  * Bugs sent to tdyc now have their package field append '-debian', to
    better reflect TDYC's tracking policies.  (Closes: #44000)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Sep 1999 01:30:15 -0500

reportbug (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug that made reportbug claim all conffiles were modified,
    even if they weren't. (Closes: #43871)
  * Now distinguishes between pseudo-headers and other headers (like
    X-Debian-CC:) in reports.  Pseudo-headers are reordered if necessary
    so they appear in the sequence: Package, Version, Severity, File.
    (Closes: #43868)
  * Fiddled around with the man page somewhat.  If it's 4 pages long, it's
    not "briefly" documenting anything anymore.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Sep 1999 00:31:42 -0500

reportbug (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add "listarchives" to the list of pseudo-packages that you can report
    bugs in.
  * Now supports --bts=gnome for the GNOME bug tracking system (a
    lightly-modified debbugs implementation).
  * debianbts.py now supports fetching individual bug reports, and
    reportbug provides an interface to this capability.  (Closes: #43219)

reportbug (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't crash if we can't query the BTS. (Closes: #43056)
  * Now supports a simple rc file in /etc/reportbug.conf or ~/.reportbugrc
    (with the contents of the latter overriding the contents of the
    former).  See man page for details.  (Closes: #42774)

  * Warn if you're reporting a bug in a non-existant package.
  * Don't crash if you're reporting a bug in a virtual package.

    Bohnet.  (Closes: #42087)
  * --version and --help no longer warn about the security implications of
    running reportbug as root.
  * Redesigned the configuration file handling system.

  * Mention $http_proxy on the man page. (Closes: #41982)
  * Provide info on packages providing virtual packages. (Closes: #42024)
  * Package listing reformatted to provide this info.  The provided
    package appears in brackets after the name.

  * "kde" now points to the KDE debbugs server. (Closes: #41629)
  * Don't lose other dependencies when pre-dependencies exist.

  * Remove extraneous diff file from source tree (introduced in 0.14).
  * Include a default severity level when prompted.  Suggestion by
    Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho. (Closes: #41332)
  * Support alternate debbugs servers, using new --bts (-B) option.
    Defaults to 'debian'; also supports 'tdyc' (or 'kde').  For
    example, to report a bug in kdebase use 'reportbug -B kde kdebase'.
    Feel free to add/suggest support for other debbugs servers.
    Suggestion by Achim Bohnet. (Closes: #41374)
  * greportbug is sorta getting there.  Any Gtk+ guru wanna tell me why my

  * Changed dependency back to python-base (>= 1.5.2-4).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jul 1999 00:10:39 -0500

reportbug (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed man page to document --no-bts-query (-b).
  * Dependency modified until unstable picks up the python 1.5.2-4 upload
    for non-PowerPC architectures; avoid using versioned dependencies on
    packages obsoleted by 1.5.2-4 to make Gregor's life easier.
  * Alias sys.stderr.write() -> ewrite()
  * No greportbug yet (sorry X fans).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Jun 1999 01:02:04 -0500

reportbug (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed several popen() calls to use the 'commands' module;
    makes for much cleaner code.
  * Changed dependency to "python-base (>= 1.5.2-4)"; avoids dependencies
    on obsolete python-{misc,net}.
  * If the package was found using --filename (-f), include that filename
    in the report header.
  * Properly handle the case where some, but not all, conffiles have been
    removed.
  * List outstanding bug reports on the package to help maintain sanity
    of developers; new option --no-bts-query (-b) added for offline use.
    (Closes: #40115)
  * Modularized somewhat in preparation for greportbug (hopefully in 0.11).
    + Common functions in /usr/lib/reportbug/*.py:
      - reportbug.py: local queries, resolving paths, outputting template
                      reports, etc.
      - debianbts.py: querying the BTS proper (nifty HTML parser).
      [These are compiled by the postinst.]

  * Merged all the "NameError: mua" bugs together in the BTS.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Jun 1999 20:39:20 -0500

reportbug (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automate version number handling, based on debian/changelog

  * The "NameError: mua" bug was fixed in 0.5; relevant bug reports have
    been closed.

reportbug (0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * You can now abbreviate bug severity levels (to first letter).
    Part of bug #38628 (the rest is reassigned to python-base).
  * Changed "file.close()" to "pipe.close()" at line 450; may fix bug

    . $DEBEMAIL will be used before $EMAIL for an address (i.e. x@y.org)
    . $DEBNAME or $NAME will be used before $USERNAME for the "real name"
      part of the address.  If neither is available, will use the real
      name from /etc/passwd.
  * Quoting of real names is now done in accordance with RFC 822.

  * Rearranged the code so options are processed before figuring out your
    email address.
  * Fixed bug #38541 (reportbug fails calling exim's /usr/sbin/sendmail).
  * Corollary: if your /usr/sbin/sendmail fails, the bug report will be
    saved as if you had no MTA.
  * Don't warn about sending configuration files if it's only because a
    conffile has been removed.
  * --filename (-f) option now handles files with symbolic links in their
    pathnames. (cfr. #23821 [bug])
  * --mutt (-M) option allows you to use mutt instead of an editor to file
    bug reports.  (cfr. #10837 [bug])
  * --af (-a) is similar, but uses the af mail reader.
  * --nmh and --mh (-n) is also similar, but uses the "comp" command from
    mh/nmh.
  * --mua allows you to do this with any mail reader that can edit draft
    messages specified on the command line.  (However, send me anything
    needed for other editors, please!)
  * New option: --version.

  * Changed virtual package date format to YYYY-MM-DD; per request from
    Jim Van Zandt on debian-devel.
  * Added a message to the report if modified configuration files were
    omitted at the user's request.
  * It's now always verbose; useful on slower systems (so you can tell
    it's actually working).
  * A few typo fixes.
